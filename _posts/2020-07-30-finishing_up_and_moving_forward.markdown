Now that I'm wrapping up my final project and my time at Flatiron, I've come to reflect on everything I have done so far with my work. Overall, my time spent learning with Learn and Flatiron as a whole has been a very pleasant experience and I've learned quite a lot, and have grown a lot as a developer over the past five or so months. With this time, I've learned how to keep my code organized, new frameworks, a new language, and have overcome a fear of mine as I've gone through with the online program and I'm thankful for the experience.

Looking back at my work, from before I started Flatiron to now, I've learned how to keep files structured nicely, how to program for web development easier, and something I've never worked with before, databases. Before now, I've never worked with databases before or even knew how to, but now I've learned how to store data, organize, query, send, and get data from API and more. With Flatiron, I've learned a lot of things I never did before such as Ruby, Rails, building an API, and building a web app with node through React and Redux. From here, I feel more confident with my coding skills and feel more comfortable with asking for help, as I used to be afraid of asking for help. Nowadays, my code is much cleaner now too, and follows a separation of concerns to keep things extra clean and DRY.

Moving forward from here, I'm starting to learn something I've wanted to learn for a while now, but before I wasn't confident enough to learn beforehand. What I'm aiming to learn next is working with Unity's game engine and moving towards my dream of learning game development fully to continue my hobby. However, in between I'm going to continue to practice my skills and go back to add more to my projects as I go on and learn more about Rails, Ruby, Javascript, and React and Redux as well.
