As of now, I finished installing new gems into my old Rails project to prepare it for some of the new features I'm adding to it, I decided to take a quick look into branching with git this week before adding in anything major. In addition to learning git, I planned out my process for how I'll be adding the features I want to add to my Rails project to make it more complex. Throughout the week, I've experimented with the way I've planned out the way I'm going to add in the new features as well, to try out a newer planning process. Now that I've taken the time to look into everything, I've started to learn and experiment with new methods and ways on how I can approach certain situations going with my project's situation.

For the first thing, besides adding in new gems, I was looking into a resource or video to help me learn branching for git. After looking through a few different sites, I came across one that I decided to use, [learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), this site has helped me learned branching, merging, and a little bit of rebasing. However, for now, I've mainly focused on learning branching and merging to help me organize the structure of my project as I make progress with the new features I'm adding. Before now, I have been only adding and committing with git to push my changes to Github. Though with the knowledge of branching,  I can now branch my project and add more to it as I branch off my features and changes before fully committing them to the master branch.

My other focus during the week was experimenting with the way I'll plan and develop my project as I work on it from here, this is where I decided to try something new and to get familiar with a new process. Usually, I list out what I'll do and check things off from there by writing things out on paper first. Though, I may try an app like [trello](https://trello.com/) to make things even more organized as I work. This time around with my project, however, I'm changing up my planning process to follow [kanban](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-kanban) through kanban boarding. The reason I chose to go with a kanban board instead of my usual to-do list of things to do for my project is to begin to familiarize myself with a form of [agile development methodlologies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/learn/agile/what-is-agile).

Now that I've learned about Kaban boarding, and git branching, its best I now start to apply what I learned and put them to the test with my new improvements to my project. During this upcoming week, I'll start to finish my project's planning by breaking down everything further than I already have from and apply it to a kanban board. Once that is set, I'll start coding everything with git branches and merge the branches to my master branch once they're ready.
