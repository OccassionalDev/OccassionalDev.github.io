As of this week, I continued with learning Angular but decided to freshen up on my Python skills and go back to learn something new with it as well. Much like how I started to learn Rspec a good week or so ago, I decided to look into testing with Python, and that led me to learn Python's unit testing library. Going from Rspec to Python's unit testing wasn't too much of a hassle to jump into as it feels similar to working with Rspec but in a different way.

Rspec was my first experience of doing test-driven development, and now that I've started learning it, Python's unit testing feels familiar as the way it is written because of it. Though Rspec is written differently than Python's unit testing, my understanding of it still stays the same, as the unit testing for Python is much like the MiniTest module for Ruby, as both use assertions for the tests, while Rspec uses expect instead. However, I may learn and use PyTest over the unit testing for Python, as it feels much closer to Rspec, its good for functional and API testing, and the use of plugins for it makes it good to have. In any case, as I continue to learn testing frameworks, I'm getting better at writing tests and getting used to working with test-driven development outside of the labs I worked with during my time learning with Flatiron. 

Before now, I've never worked with writing tests or worked with writing tests on my projects, but as I continue with them, the benefits of using them begin to show their way to me. Since I've started to learn Rspec in particular, the tests help me keep track of what was still working with my programs as I went on to develop them and see if any old functions, in particular, broke as I made new functions. Testing overall has helped me confirm that things in my programs still worked as I went on to fix and improve my programs and as well as add to them. Going forward from here, I'm going to continue to add tests to my programs and get better with test-driven development on my projects.
