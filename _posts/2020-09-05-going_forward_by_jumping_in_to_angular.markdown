For now, I've finished learning Ruby, JavaScript, React and Redux, but I'm not going to stop learning from those. However, as I write this blog post, I've started to learn more frameworks such as Angular and Nest.js, meanwhile on the side I look further in to Node.js and its capabilities. When it came to picking between Angular and Nest.js to start with, I've chose to put my focus on learning Angular first before jumping right in to Nest.js. While I begin to start to learn Angular, it feels familiar to the way I work with Ruby on Rails with the way its tructured, but still having some things that are compareable to React.


Though, while Angular does work with a MVC file structure like Rails, it still takes a different front on learning it, as it is a front-end framework, but in some different ways like I've learned React. One of the ways I'd had to change my approach to learning Angular, was not jumping in right away, as I've had to take some time to learn [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) first. Unlike React, Angular uses a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) workflow, and offers a few different things out of the box when compared to React, besides the way its structured. While looking around, I've found this [post](https://programmingwithmosh.com/react/react-vs-angular/) particularly helpful when it came to looking deeper in to how Angular compares to React and the advantages and disadvantages both provide.


One of the nice advantages I can say that I've had while working with Angular instead of React is the way the file structure is, and the template system, as it feels like working with Rails, but on a front-end instead. Though, on the other hand with React, while lacking a MVC structure, it feels more flexible to work with thanks to the libararies it has like [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), or having the option to work with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). However, Angular does have more things to go over in regard to what it can do, React is more straight forward as it feels less complex with writing states, components, and props throughout it. Angular, in comparison to React in complexity has much more topics to cover than React, as of now I'm finishing up on learning how to write modules, and this is just the begining of what Angular has to offer.


All around, Angular as I'm starting to work with it now feels like a very organized front-end framework to work with in terms of the way it gets setup with its structures. However, I feel I'm going to be spending quite some time learning Angular to grasp all the concepts that come along with it. Going forward from here, I am going to continue to learn Angular, and then jump in to Flask afterwords to continue to work with python more.
