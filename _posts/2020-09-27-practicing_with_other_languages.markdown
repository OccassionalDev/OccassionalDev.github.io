Another week has gone by, and I started to come up with an idea for the next project to work on to implement Angular in. However, I took some time off to work with some of the other languages I know and practice with them this time around. Moving from language to language is quite easy, and even easier to write similar code all around. Though, I do find myself referring to the documentation of other languages I work to see if there are any built-in functions I can use to DRY my code up with. Finding challenges wasn't hard either, as I could take one that I worked on and reuse it to see if I can write a solution in another language too.

I've been using [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/) as my preferred platform to practice my coding skills with all the languages I work with to practice with. Overall, it has been a pretty good platform to practice with, as the community on there has been making challenges to do and the level of difficulty of them is good to scale around with. I've been practicing this week mostly with Python, C#, and C++, as I plan to make projects with these languages later on. Though with other languages such as Ruby, and JavaScript, I've been using them frequently in projects I've been working on, but I still work on my skills with them in Code Wars to keep my algorithm building skills in good shape.

As of late as well, I've been looking into [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), and other platforms as well to practice on to find more challenges to work with. Though I may work with Code Wars more since there are always more challenges from the community coming in from it. However, in the end, regardless of the platform, practice is practice and it helps out with getting better building algorithms.
